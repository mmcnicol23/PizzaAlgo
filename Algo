1. Go to Dominos.com
2. Find the type of pizza you want to order. 
    Note: I like to use the "Choose any 2 or more for $6.99 each" coupon. 
3. Add the pizza to your cart.
4. Add your credit card information. 
5. Place your order. 
6. Wait for your pizza to arrive, or go pick up your order at the Domino's location. 
    6a. If you ordered delivery, be sure to tip your driver!
7. Enjoy your pizza!
8. Recycle your pizza box. Make sure all food is removed from it first. 
    It is ok if the box is a little greasy!
